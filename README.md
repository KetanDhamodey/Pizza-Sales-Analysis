## 1. Project Title : Pizza Sales Analytics Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze 🍕 pizza sales performance across categories and time periods—focusing on revenue, quantity sold, and customer ordering trends to support data-driven business decisions.

## 2. Description / Purpose
The Pizza Sales Analytics Dashboard is a Power BI report built to analyze transactional pizza sales data and uncover key business insights such as top-performing pizza categories, revenue trends, and order distribution by day and month. The dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly evaluate sales performance and identify patterns that can support operational and marketing decisions.

## 3. Tech Stack
The dashboard was developed using the following tools and technologies:
📊 Power BI Desktop – Primary platform used for data modeling and interactive data visualization

📂 Power Query – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and feature extraction (day and month names from order dates)

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Implemented for calculated measures, KPIs, and dynamic insights

🧱 Data Modeling – Structured relationships between fact and dimension tables to enable accurate aggregation and filtering

📁 File Formats – .pbix for report development and .csv as the raw data source
